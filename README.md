# 📌 Stash – Productivity Platform for Opportunity Hoarders

**Stash** is a smart content-saving and productivity platform designed for students and young professionals who often stumble upon valuable opportunities—job posts, hackathons, scholarships, internships—while scrolling social media… and then forget all about them.

This platform enables users to quickly **save, sort, and track** such content — so they never miss out again.

## 💡 What It Does

- 📤 **Share to Save**  
  Users can directly share posts from any app (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) into Stash using Android's native share feature *(to be implemented)*.

- 🧠 **Smart Categorization**  
  Detects content type (job, event, scholarship, etc.) using planned AI/NLP integration.

- ⏳ **Deadline Detection**  
  Extracts time-sensitive information and auto-sets reminders *(MVP includes manual reminder input)*.

- 📊 **Personal Dashboard**  
  View saved content, filter by category, see upcoming deadlines, and track engagement.

- 🤖 **AI Chatbot (Mock Prototype)**  
  Ask questions like:
  - "What hackathons are ending this week?"
  - "Summarize this job post."

- 📶 **Offline Sync (Planned)**  
  Save even while offline. Data syncs once back online.

## 🎯 Vision

> Stash isn’t just another to-do list. It’s your personal opportunity tracker.

We aim to bridge the gap between content discovery and action by letting users save while scrolling—without disrupting their browsing. The app will work silently in the background, auto-organizing and reminding users before deadlines hit.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend (Mobile)**: Flutter (UI built with v0.dev)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (planned)
- **NLP + AI**: GPT / LLMs, Dateparser (planned)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (web), Play Store (in future)
